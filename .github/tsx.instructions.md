## Class names

When suggesting code, if there is a long className string, break it into multiple lines using semantic groups. For example, group layout-related classes together, spacing together, typography together, colors together, and transitions/animations together. Keep each line under 80 characters. Format JSX attributes so the opening tag, className, and other props are readable. Always produce clean multiline className strings in your suggestions
