# General Instructions

## Semantic Versioning

- The `package.json` file must always follow npm semantic versioning.
- Each pull request should update the version according to the type of change:
  - Patch / Bug fix: increment the patch version (`x.x.PATCH`)
  - Minor: increment the minor version (`x.MINOR.x`)
  - Major / Breaking change: increment the major version (`MAJOR.x.x`)
- Suggestions should commit the updated version along with the relevant changes.
